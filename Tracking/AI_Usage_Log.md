## AI Tool Session #1
**Date**: January 14, 2026
**Time**: Afternoon
**AI Tool Used**: GitHub Copilot (Claude Sonnet 4)
**Task**: Project planning and documentation setup

### Prompt(s) Provided:
```
1. "I added the instructions for my first Distributed Systems Project. Let's create a file that has a step by step checklist of what I need to do. I'm working on a mac, and I'll probably write the code in java, unless a different language would be considerably better. I'm also open to using python."

2. "Now read through the two files here, and let's create files for everything that I need to keep track of. I know there is a req to include Ai involvement. We will need a file for that. There is also one for documenting when and by whom each action was taken."
```

### AI Response(s):
```
AI provided:
1. Comprehensive step-by-step checklist (Project_Checklist.md) breaking down all 3 questions with timeline, recommended Java+Python approach, macOS-specific instructions
2. Four tracking files:
   - AI_Usage_Log.md (for Q3 AI documentation requirement)
   - Action_Log.md (time/student documentation with date;whoami format)
   - Docker_Commands_Reference.md (Q1 command categorization requirement)
   - Progress_Tracker.md (overall project management)
```

### How I Used This Answer:
- [x] Used files directly as provided
- [ ] Modified the code before using
- [ ] Used as reference/guidance only
- [ ] Combined with other sources
- [ ] Other: ___________

**Specific Implementation Details**:
- Created organized project structure with separate Tracking/ folder
- All tracking templates ready for documentation as work progresses
- Checklist provides clear 2-week timeline with language recommendations (Java+Python for cross-language communication)
- Files address all specific documentation requirements from project instructions
